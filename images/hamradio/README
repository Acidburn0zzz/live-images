Debian Hamradio Blend Live Image
================================

This is the live-build configuration used to build the Debian Hamradio Blend
Live hybrid CD images.

Debian Hamradio Blend Live is a live system based on Debian testing and
includes the Debian Hamradio Blend's packages and general productivity
packages. It only includes those packages that are available in the official
Debian main archive (that is, not including contrib or non-free) as far as is
possible. During the initial development, this rule may be bent a bit.

The image also includes an installer that allows you to install the live image
to a hard drive which can then be used as if it had been installed with the
official Debian installer, but with a different set of packages installed
initially.
